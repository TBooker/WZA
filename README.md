# WZA
A repository containing the analysis scripts and simulation configuration files to accompany our project on the Weighted-Z Analysis for GEA (WZA) 

## Note
I was using this repository while developing and performing analyses for the project described in our preprint.

There is another WZA repository that contains more complete READMEs and information under the CoAdapTree GitHub profile: [https://github.com/CoAdapTree/WZA](https://github.com/CoAdapTree/WZA)
